abstract: Road landmark inventory is becoming an important data product for the maintenance of transport infrastructures. Several commercial sensors are available which include synchronized optical cameras that allowto build 360° panoramic images of the surroundings of the vehicle used for road inspection. This paper is devoted to the analysis of such panorama images,specifically the area that contains themost relevant information. Road lane landmark detection is posed as a two class classification problem that may be solved bymachine learningapproaches, such as Random Forest (RF) and ensembles of Extreme Learning Machines (V-ELM). Besides model parameter selection, a central problem is the construction of a labeled training and validation datasetto cope with the highly uncontrolled conditions of image capture. Besides, human labor cost makes image data labeling a very expensive process. This paper proposes an open ended Active Learning (AL) approach involving a human oraclein the loop who provides the data labeling and can trigger the AL process when detection quality is degraded by the change in imaging conditions. The paper reports encouraging results over a collection of sample images selected from an industrial road landmark inventory operation. As an additional contribution, this paper assesses the ability of AL to overcomesome of the issues raised by highly class imbalanced datasets.
